Thanks for stopping by my website on the internet. Here, I write about programming, startups, 
online privacy, tech and document my experiences.

My day job is writing code and building products. I mostly work with JavaScript. During my free time I learn new stuff, build 
products, contribute to open source and play the piano.

Vintage and automatic watches have always sparked my imagination. It's fascinating that how a watch 
made up of 300 tiny pieces arranged in a 42mm diameter case could function for a centuary or two. 
It's funny that we were never able to build a phone that could last more than a couple of years with
all the modern technology we have. Here is my favourite pair of 
[talking hands](https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfinder) on the internet.
